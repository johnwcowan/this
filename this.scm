"If you think this is bullshit, it probably is.  Nevertheless:
Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit renaming is faster, but not clearer, than implicit.
Simple outsides hide complex insides.
Nested is what Lisp is all about.
Readability counts.
It's all special cases, and that's why we have macros.
Practicality and purity are equally important.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless speed is set higher than safety.
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
There should be every way to do it.
Now is better than never.
But think before you code.
If the implementation is hard to explain, explain it.
If the implementation is easy to explain, explain it.
There is (almost) only one namespace.
